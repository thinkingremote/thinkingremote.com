It’s easy to hear that there is a film about Hendrix with no original music from the man himself and scoff…there’s no way that kind of story could be interesting, purposeful, or even remotely compelling. But in an oddball, aloof, alluring way (maybe much like Jimi himself), “Jimi: All Is By My Side” is one of the [most compelling]() music related biopics I’ve ever seen. But it’s not without damning flaws that are impossible to dismiss.

If you’re thirsty for a progressive take on films, especially biopics, yet want a film about Jimi Hendrix to focus on his music/creativity, this film will simultaneously delight and piss you off. At it’s best, it veers away rebelliously from any expectations of what a biopic should be. This movie is a celebration of minutiae. Here we view a slice of Jimi’s life, as interpreted by the director, through what feels like a keyhole. There are only blurry hints of his tumultuous upbringing, subsequent dues paying and his impending godhood. 

And that is the biggest weak point of the film. For every moment we’re given what could be a thoughtful glimpse into the pensive, wandering, hilarious thought process of a hero we never really quite got to know and the things he loved, we’re given two moments of grasping for straws and time-sucking meandering. We’re presented a Jimi with no real drive and motivations of his own, bounced around and guided by external forces. 

And while an arguably brilliant take on the biopic genre, and a solid job by a strong cast, we still haven’t gotten the Jimi dramatization we need (or that he deserves)… but maybe we’re getting closer. Whatever your relationship with Jimi and his music, you should watch this one and consider it a small imperfect piece of a puzzle we’re all still putting together.
