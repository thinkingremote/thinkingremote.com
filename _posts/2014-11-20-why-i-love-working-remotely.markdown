Picture this, you are left with nothing more than a laptop and a high speed internet connection, that's all.  Can you survive?  Answering this question, or even asking this question a few decades ago would be deemed irrelevant.  The internet was still in its infancy and a typical computer was a behemoth desktop.  Free Skype calls from one corner of the globe to another, streaming high definition videos on YouTube, and a slew of other online services, which these days we take for granted, simply didn't exist.  Things have changed, a lot.  

I am fascinated by the opportunities the internet creates for humanity.  In a world still divided by borders the internet is, even if not perfectly so, an open arena, allowing anyone, anywhere, access to a massive pool of information and a connection to billions of other human beings.  As this is my first blog post for our newly launched ThinkingRemote website I decided to dedicate it to talking about what I find most appealing about remote working.  There are of course plenty of challenges too, but we'll leave those for later.


## Efficiency Is Key

Time is the most precious things in life.  It's easy to forget but we have only a finite amount of time to live our lives. We should guard and manage our time properly.  Having said that, it's pretty clear that efficiency is an important thing for me.  Working remotely allows me to use my time most efficiently.  I work when I feel that I can be productive.  And when I stop being productive I don't force myself to continue.  Instead I go out for a long walk, or do my daily exercise

 routine and by the time I'm done I'm usually ready for another productive session of work.  I can't picture myself in an office setting having to work efficiently for eight hours straight.  Honestly, I don't know how other people do it.  They either obtain a quality which I lack or they just aren’t being productive for the full eight hours.  


## Time Saver

According to the U.S Census Bureau the average commute time in the US is 25 minutes.  Which means the average American worker spends about 20 hours a month commuting.  Not to mention those who live in big cities like San Francisco, New York and Los angeles, where the average commute time is as high as 90 minutes, or 72 monthly hours.  For the average remote worker the meaning of commute is transferring oneself from the bedroom to the living room or the study.    


## Better State of Mind

But it's not just the time suck that makes commuting not appealing.  Commuting is rarely an enjoyable experience and often involves a fair amount of stress.  Driving in rush hour traffic, trying to find a spot in a crowded bus, walking in rain or snow in noisy streets.  I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy these activities and I suspect many feel the way I do.   Having to go through the stress of the commute means that by the time one finally gets to work he/she needs another period of time just to get into the right state of mind in order to start working.  


## Money Saver

Another big advantage for not having to commute is saving money.  First on the list is the money spent on gas or public transportation.  Depending on the distance, these can add up to quite a lot of money.  Not only time is wasted, but the commuter often needs to pay for it out of pocket.  Next on the list is parking, which in big cities can add up to hundreds of dollars per month.  

Then there are less trivial money savers, such as money saved on dining-in instead of having lunch in a restaurant.  Or the clothes one needs to purchase and the occasional birthday presents for coworkers.  Remote workers don't need to show up to work with a particular dress code or shiny shoes, and they are not obliged to participate in social events.


## It's Better For The Earth

Perhaps one of the most gratifying things for me about working remotely is knowing that I am not polluting the earth by commuting to work.  Imagine how the world would look if half of its population worked from home.  Global warming is no longer a distant threat, it is right near our doorstep and we need to do all we can to stop it.


Remote working may not be the right fit for everyone.  For me, I can’t picture a different work setting.  The advantages presented by working from home surpass the challenges, which I’ll discuss in my next article.  We’d love to hear your take about remote working, let us know your thoughts in the comments.
