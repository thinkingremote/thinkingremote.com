What most people don’t know, is that the company has been run near exclusivly remote for over ten years. The founders and authors, David and Jason combined have a comprehensive breadth of experience and address every argument against remote work whilst also identifying key benefits that seem counter intuitive to most.

> Working remotely isn't without complication or occasional sacrifice. It's about making things better for more people more of the time.

There is surprisingly very little literature on the topic of remote work, so we thought it necessary to review one of the only, maybe the only, recently published books about working remote.

<a href="http://37signals.com/remote/"><img src="/images/remote.png" style="border: 1px solid #333; float: left; width: 240px; margin-right: 25px;margin-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" /></a>

That book in question is called [REMOTE](http://37signals.com/remote/) and is authored by the founders of a company called [37 Signals](https://37signals.com) which is hailed as one of the great successful software companies in the 21st century. What most people don't know, is that the company has been run near exclusivly remote for over ten years. The founders and authors, David and Jason combined have a comprehensive breadth of experience and address every argument against remote work whilst also identifying key benefits that seem counter intuitive to most.

Not only do they have a successful company to give strength to their anecdotes but their product <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> is also widely used by remote workers which has given them futher insight. One last reason to also take what they seriously is that <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, one of the most successful open source web frameworks to date was also conceived under their guidance.  Ruby on Rails has over 3000 contributors world wide and is developed asynchronously by remote workers. 

This is first and foremost a critical book review, and from my experience it is easier to be critical than to acknowledge the good qualities. Regardless of the critical aspects of the review, I still whole heartledly recommend this book to anyone who has ever entertained the idea of remote work, be it managers or employees.

## WHAT DOES THE BOOK COVER?

Although the section titles are mostly descriptive of the contents, a small portion of them will leave you simply curious until you read them. For those of you have read [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) by Dale Carnegie, you may notice a certain influence on the writing style and structure of the book. Instead of covering business practises through the lens of personability, this book simply looks through the lens of how remote work affects day to day affairs. You will find plenty of anecdotes scattered through narrative fashion as they go through the daily life of working at a software company.

If you find yourself constantly debating with people about the concept of remote work, this book will leave you well equipped with arguments, counter arguments and simple memorable quotes to recall.  For example:

## The work is what matters

"The work is what matters" is one of the section titles, a powerful remark and the major theme of this book. When discussing the topic, this remark is what you always have to keep in mind. If somebody says "Ryan will just stay home and blast music all day while he eats Mac and Cheese", so what? Ryan might be highly productive after eating a kilogram of Mac and Cheese, "The work is what matters".

In this section, Jason and David talk about how software development inherently leaves a paper trail of employees work through version control and issue trackers making employee auditing a relatively easy process. Due to the non-personal nature of remote work, everyone is judged largely on their productive output. Instead of people floating around the office, making bro jokes at the water cooler or telling crazy stories about their youth, everyone is treated equally by there work and being the cool guy is no longer an excuse to get away with not their fair share of the work. It doesn't matter what time people choose to work either, "The work is what matters". 

> When it's all about the work, it's clear who in the company is pulling their weight and who isn't

## We can all do with fewer M&M's

In fear of repeating the above phrase too much, let's move on to another central theme, efficiency. The authors argue pretty adamantly that office work has turned into nothing but distractions or "interruption factories" as the authors label it. They believe that arguing that remote work is inefficient isn't of too much concern and on the contrary we should be looking at how inefficient office work has become. 

> Meetings should be like salt – sprinkled carefully to enhance a dish, not poured recklessly over every forkful. Too much salt destroys a dish

<img src="/images/mnm.jpg" style="float: right; width: 280px; margin-left: 25px;margin-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

Cheekily called M&M's, the authors believe that **managers** and **meetings** are actually counter productive when used excessively, which by the tone of the text, the authors consider quite often. Admittedly the amount of quips and qualms on meetings gets a bit repetitive whilst reading through the chapters.

Their argument isn't that office work is completely inefficient but instead they beg the question:

> ...ask yourself: Where do you go when you really have to get work done? Your answer won't be "the office in the afternoon."

Here they use anecdotes from their own personal experience and their employees to back up the claim, that everybody is unique in when they are productive each day. In essence, why make somebody sit in the office from 9-5 when they might be most switched on from 12-7.

There are chapters that cover other basic inefficiencies with working at the office, such as wasting time communiting and the banal repetitiveness. Though lot of these chapters are pretty self evident to the average office worker. Though there are some brillant sections about the benefits that would seem almost counter intuitive. For example, there is a section titled "I need an answer now!" which postulates that people who work in traditional offices work in a synchronous fashion. Such that, if they need something, they will immediately contact the person required which obviously distracts that person from what they were doing. The person who needed something, will also now just sit and wait in anticipation for that person to reply. You now have disrupted two peoples productivity. Working remotely you structure your time around doing things asynchronously which in turn lets you and your co-workers work for longer stints of time undistracted. 

## VAGUE ANSWERS

For the most part, the book offers compelling answers to common questions. Though some answersdon't offer full solutions, for example the question "Big business doesn't do it, so why should we?", is covered in two pages, the only real point made is that "old" business is unwillingly to change its ways and that bureaucracy plagues their decision making. A large portion of the software engineer workforce belongs to big business, and convincing them is exponential harder than your every day software boutique. 

<iframe width="360" style="float: right;" height="215" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cZY-3bzJW-0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I'd expect a much more comprehensive answer here as to how even simple logistical problems could be solved for big business e.g. scaling 1000 remote workers is harder than 30. The lack of content in this section makes sense when you take into account the philosophy behind a company like 37 signals who favor having a small company.

The book is riddled with general business advice for small companies and you can smell the disdain for big business easily. Unfortunately for those who find themselves in corporate environments while the book will no doubt be useful in attempting to unleash yourself from the office, I fear it may not provide all the material needed to convince your big business bosses.

Another section titled "Others would get jealous" highlights that people fear that co-workers might feel jealousy or envy if some people are remote and they are not which will lead to low company morale. One of the points they make as to why this problem doesn't really exist is:

> The guy sending packages from the warehouse already has a different job from the girl running the books in accounting. Different jobs, different requirements. People get that

Though postulating "people get that" might not be enough, the guy in the warehouse might wholeheartedly be jealous of the girl working in accounting. 

> The best way to defuse the "everyone must be bound by the same policy" line of argument is to remind your boss, yourself, and any other concerned party that you're all on the same team

I personally am not fully convinced that is enough to alleviate the problem, and it sounds too much like political rhetoric. If a company isn't fully remote like 37signals, and it is a pick and choose situation for who gets remote, I believe you will run into hurdles that this book has no advice for.

## This book deserves to be read by the industry

This book deserves to be read by the industry, if not simply for the fact they are pioneers in remote thought. 

**If you already work remotely**, the book is comforting in the fact that they cover almost all the unique experiences of remote work and you will find joy in identifying with problems they have experienced and tips on how to get around them.  I'd highly recommend the chapter "Freedom is slavery".

**If you work in or manage a small company**, the authors believe it is in both parties best interest to join the remote revolution, I feel they quite adequately cover everything you need to know on how to make this a real possibility.  The best section for small companies to read is "The work is what matters".

**If you work in a large organization**, I am unsure of how this book will help you. They do reference a lot of large companies who do work remotely and your best bet is to read those references and independently research more about how those companies work. Read the section "That wouldn't work for our size or industry".

As far as the content and writing style of the book go, I quite like the Dale Carnegie style fashion and also believe this book would benefit greatly from periodic revisions and publications. Some of the sections feel a bit too much like a run of the mill self help book content because they lack anecdotes, references or statistics. 

> The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time. Once you've had a taste of that life, no corner office or fancy chef will be able to draw you back..

If you know anybody teetering on the brink of remote work, who just needs a slight nudge to plunge over the edge, it would make an ideal present.

## NOTES

* THe book suggest contractors and open source developers share similar habits to a great remote worker
* When talking about family life, they forget to mention that pregnant women would highly benefit from being able to work from home.
