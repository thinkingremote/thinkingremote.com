In my last <a href="http://thinkingremote.com/why-i-love-working-remotely/" target="_blank">blog post</a> I talked about the advantages of working remotely.  But as I briefly mentioned in the post, remoting also has its cons and it poses quite a few challenges.  In this post I’d like to examine some of these challenges, while in my next post I will share my approach to dealing with some of the challenges.  


## Self Discipline and Work Ethic

A successful remoter must obtain self discipline and a healthy work ethic.  It is much harder to slack at work while being in an office setting than to do so alone at home.  Co-workers and managers observe each other.  They know what time one shows up, how intensely, or not, he is working, and at what time he leaves the office.  In the office, workers think twice before checking Facebook, email, or a million other distractions.  

Things are different as a remoter.  The remoter is usually home, alone, or with family, who often would love for him to be distracted and spend more time with them.  There’s no boss or co-workers around, no one to give a stinky eye if you arrive late to work or leave early.  Staying focused becomes a real hurdle.  

Those who have to work in an office setting normally have to obey certain written or unwritten company rules.  As much as these rules may seem annoying or unnecessary, they in fact make most people’s lives easier.  These rules define the way workers should behave and by doing so the worker’s responsibility is diminished to following the rules.  Show up on time, do your job, go home, repeat.  The remote worker has to define these rules for himself.  And he needs to supervise himself to ensure he follows these rules.  It requires a great deal of self discipline and a higher than average work ethic.  


## It’s Lonely Here

If socializing is high on your priority list you should think twice before going remote.  Remoters spend most of their working days at home in front of the computer.  I’ve had patches of days where I didn’t leave my house at all and the only social interaction I had was via chat and Skype.  Working in an office setting forces workers to interact with each other, whether they like it or not.  Interaction with co-workers, even if not in a direct way to work, can lead to exchange of information and sprout new ideas.  Steve Jobs knew that.  That’s why he designed Apple’s headquarters in a way that forced workers to 'bump' into each other.  

On the contrary, the remote worker will never bump into a co-worker while taking a coffee break, he will not have the random chance of hearing about the co-worker’s project, or his adventure from last weekend.  The remote worker usually spends time on computer chat when he needs to discuss something specific, which in most cases is related to what he is currently working on.  


## Out Of Sight Out Of Mind

Whether willing to admit it or not, physical proximity plays a large role when managers assign new projects or when a new opportunity presents itself.  No matter how awesome remoter are, it's easy to forget about them.  The fact that they are not in the office, perhaps subconsciously, degrades their perceived involvement and commitment.  They are often looked at as outsiders who are there to support, but aren't quite equal citizens of the company.  This phenomena can lead to problems and frustrations.  Remoters may feel that they are not receiving equal opportunities and promotions as their in-office co-workers. 


## Satellite Vs. Command Room

Remoters are like satellites.  They do their own thing and report back to the main command room.  In other words, remoters would rarely get an opportunity to be the command room, to manage a large team and to have others report back to them.  Despite the ease of use of online meetings one can argue that managing a team is significantly easier when most of the team, and of course its manager, are in the same physical location.  When I asked my co-founder, Joey Flores, what would he have done differently with Earbits, first on his list was get an office and eliminate the need to remote manage a team.  



Don’t get me wrong, despite all the cons presented above I still love working remotely.  I only thought it would be fair to discuss both sides of the coin and hopefully provide useful information to those who are currently working, or are considering working remotely.  If you feel that you obtain self discipline and high work ethic, if you enjoy spending long hours on your own, if you are less interested in managing others, then remote working is probably the right thing for you.
