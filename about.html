<p>ThinkingRemote is a place to learn and share information about working remotely. 
Internet connectivity allows a growing number of people to work remotely without 
the need to ever set foot in an office.  But telecommuting is not for everyone, 
it has its fair share of pros and cons.</p>

<p>Our mission, as two lifelong remoters, is to explore all the different aspects
of this relatively new lifestyle. We hope to create a knowledge-rich platform 
which will allow remoters and those who consider becoming remote workers to exchange
ideas, find solutions, answer questions, and contribute to the ever growing community
of remote workers.</p>
